<PageDescription>

Now that we have an application using the Dotcom Shell, it’s time to include some out-of-the-box components
from the [Carbon for IBM.com library](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/story/overview-getting-started--page)
in the page. In this step, we’ll become comfortable with various Carbon for IBM.com components.

## Preview

A [preview]() of what you'll build:

## Fork, clone, and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial) that we'll use
as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream
remote, go ahead and do so by following the <Link to="/developing/web-components-tutorial">step 1 instructions</Link>.

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b web-components-step-2 upstream/web-components-step-2
```

## Component documentation

In this step, you'll be adding 4 new components to the page; [Leadspace with search](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/story/components-lead-space-search--default),
[Table of contents - horizontal](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/story/components-table-of-contents--horizontal),
[Card section offset](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/story/components-card-section-offset--default), and
[CTA section with linked list](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/story/components-cta-section--with-link-list). All components have
implementation details in the linked Storybook Docs tab. The Docs tab has a link to the codesandbox example of each component, props table to showcase different variations possible, and other
key information. This is a great place to look back to if you're ever stuck.

  **Note:** We’ve included the designs for this tutorial app in the `design.pdf`
  file found as a top-level file in the carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial
  repository. You may notice there are additional components not listed above,
  but dont' worry those additional components we'll be adding in Step 3.

## Add Leadspace with search

First let's incorporate `Leadspace with search` in our page. This can be done in two easy steps.

Import the following into `app.js`:

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components/es/components/dotcom-shell/index.js';
```

Next, add the following code (which you can find in the `Leadspace with search` [Storybook Docs](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/docs/components-lead-space-search--default)) within the `<dds-dotcom-shell-container>` tags in `index.html`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
<div class="bx--grid">
  <div class="bx--row">
    <div class="bx--col-lg-8 bx--offset-lg-4 bx--no-gutter">
      <dds-leadspace-with-search>
        <dds-leadspace-block-heading slot="heading"
          >Find analytics services</dds-leadspace-block-heading
          >
        <dds-leadspace-block-content slot="content">
          <dds-leadspace-search-block-heading
            >Make fast and accurate data-based
            decisions
          </dds-leadspace-search-block-heading
            >
        </dds-leadspace-block-content>
        <dds-search-with-typeahead
          slot="search"
          leadspace-search></dds-search-with-typeahead>
      </dds-leadspace-with-search>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Nice! You have just added the `Leadspace with search` component to the page! But wait...the color of the component doesn't match the design.
Looking at the props table in the documentation, there is a `adjacent-theme` property we can pass to the component to adjust the theme.

Let's do that by setting `adjacent-theme="g90-and-g100"` in `dds-leadspace-with-search`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
  <dds-leadspace-with-search adjacent-theme="g90-and-g100">
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now `Leadspace with search` should display the proper theme. Great job! Let's move on to the next component.

## Add Table of contents - horizontal

`Table of contents` is a great component to structure the page. We'll be using the horizontal variation in this step.

Let's added the import to the `app.js` file:

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components/es/components/table-of-contents/index.js';
```

Next we'll lay the foundation for the next two components that will be incorporated within the `Table of contents`. Add the following
below the `Leadspace with search` component.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
  <dds-table-of-contents toc-layout="horizontal" stickyOffset="48">
    <a name="1" data-title="First Item"></a>
    <h1>I am the first item in the table of contents</h1>
  </dds-table-of-contents>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You should see the `Table of contents` with one item listed. Each item in the `Table of contents` will need a preceding anchor element
with a unique `name` and title of the item as`data-title.` That's it!

## Add Card section offset

## Submit pull request

We're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.

### Continuous integration (CI) check

Run the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.

```bash
yarn ci-check
```

### Git commit and push

Before we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:

```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "feat(tutorial): complete step 2"
```

Then, push to your repository:

```bash
git push origin web-components-step-2
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?

<Link to="/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push">

</Link> has troubleshooting notes that may help.

</InlineNotification>

### Pull request (PR)

Finally, visit [carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial)
to "Compare & pull request". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing `web-components-step-2` into
`base: web-components-step-2`.

Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon for IBM.com team but not merged. We'll close your PR so we
can keep the repository's remote branches pristine and ready for the next person!

If your PR fails the Github Actions test with the error `Can't make a request in offline mode`, try running the
following command: `rm -rf .yarn-offline-mirror node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install`. Add and commit the
changes once this completes, and try pushing again.
